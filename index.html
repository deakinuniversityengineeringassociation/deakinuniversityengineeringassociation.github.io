							<p>Founded with the goal of providing our members with the opportunity to converse with peers about academic interests and to develop meaningful professional connections within industry, DUEA has adopted the form of an online community; serving both Cloud and on-campus students alike.</p>
							<p>Academic, technical and professional pursuits relevant to the Deakin Engineering majors are our key focus, as well as providing a valuable platform for our members to socialise and make the most of their time at university.</p>
							<p>Our online discussion group includes members at all stages of their Engineering careers, from First Year students right through to Graduates, Researchers and Deakin Staff, with our diverse membership representing each of the Waurn Ponds, Burwood and Cloud (Online) campuses.</p>
							<p>As an organisation we strive for the seamless inclusion and representation of our members regardless of which campus they may happen to study or work at; everyone is welcome. We are of the firm belief that this policy of inclusiveness will serve each of our members well as they progress through their education and well on into their professional lives.</p>
							<p>Suffice to say, we would be delighted and would very much welcome any Deakin Engineering Graduates, Researchers or Staff in addition to any current Deakin Engineering students to the DUEA family.</p>
